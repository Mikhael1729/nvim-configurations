# TDD

Test Driven Development or TDD is a methodology of writing software that consists on first writing a failure test (compilation error also count as a failure test) and then creating or modifying the code that makes the test pass.

The following are 3 simple rules of writing using TDD methodology:

1. You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.
2. You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.
3. You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.
